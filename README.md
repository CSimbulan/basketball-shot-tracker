# Basketball Shot Tracker

Basketball Shot Tracker is an app for athletes to track their shots for a shooting workout.

Users can mark spots where they took shots from on a grid overlayed on a basetkball court.

Through the UI the user can add how many makes and attemps they took from a marked spot.

Once the user is finished with a workout they can save it to the database and view or edit it later in the profile page.

The profile page will also contain analytics, which will show trends in the user's shooting percentages over time.
